Intent: Decorator Pattern

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to sub classing for extending functionality.


Example: Streams -> InputStream -> BufferedInputStream -> LineNumberInputStream

Whenever we need add decorate an object with additional responsibilities, this pattern can be used.
