Intent: Behavioral pattern
	Define a family of algorithms encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
	Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

Strategy pattern follows below two design principles,
	1. Separate the things which varies (Usage interface and classes which implement them)
	2. Favor composition over inheritance(Usage of object references over extends)
	
Pattern categories : Creational, Behavior and Structural
